# Mumbai Home Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict home prices in Mumbai using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors such as location, size, amenities, and neighborhood characteristics, the model predicts the selling price of homes in Mumbai's real estate market.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Gathered real estate data from various sources including property listings, government records, and real estate agencies to build a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Conducted data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization to prepare the dataset for machine learning modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and identify patterns in the data.
- **Machine Learning Modeling**: Developed machine learning models using regression techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests to predict home prices based on input features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared to assess predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities.
- **Deployment**: Deployed the trained model as a web application or API, allowing users to input property details and receive predicted home prices in real-time.

## Usage
To use the Mumbai Home Price Prediction system:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the main application script, `main.py`, and follow the instructions to input property details and obtain predicted prices.
4. Explore the results and adjust input parameters as needed for accurate predictions.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of additional data sources and features to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.
- Implementation of advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods and deep learning for more accurate and reliable predictions.
- Development of a user-friendly interface for easier interaction and visualization of predicted home prices.
